Format as JSON:
{
  "milestones": [...],
  "sprintPlan": {...},

}
`;
  
  return await claude.generateDreamBlueprint(prompt);
};
```

### Section-Specific Prompts

#### Milestone Generation
```
Given the dream "${dream}" and their current situation, create 5-7 major milestones that:
- Build progressively from current state to dream achievement
- Have realistic timeframes based on typical achievement patterns
- Include both skill development and tangible achievements
- Account for common obstacles and plateaus
- Celebrate meaningful progress points
```

#### 90-Day Plan Generation
```
Create a detailed 90-day action plan that:
- Starts with immediate, easy wins to build momentum
- Gradually increases complexity and commitment
- Focuses on habit formation in first 30 days
- Introduces creation/building in days 31-60
- Pushes for first real results in days 61-90
- Maintains sustainable pace to prevent burnout
```

#### Routine Generation
```
Design daily routines that:
- Require minimal initial time investment (start small)
- Can be integrated into existing schedule
- Build progressively over time
- Create compound effects
- Are specific to their dream requirements
```

#### Mindset Shift Generation
```
Identify the critical mindset shifts by:
- Analyzing gap between current state and dream state
- Identifying common limiting beliefs in this domain
- Providing evidence-based new beliefs
- Creating bridge thoughts for difficult transitions
- Focusing on identity-level changes
```

### State Management
```javascript
const dashboardState = {
  loading: false,
  dreamData: {
    description: "",
    assessmentAnswers: {}
  },
  blueprint: {
    milestones: [],
    sprintPlan: {},

  viewState: {
    activeSection: 0,
    expandedItems: {}
  }
};
```

## Integration Points

### API Endpoints Needed
```
POST /api/generate-blueprint
Body: {
  dreamDescription: string,
  assessmentAnswers: object
}
Response: {
  blueprint: BlueprintObject
}

GET /api/blueprint/:userId
Response: {
  blueprint: BlueprintObject,
  progress: ProgressObject
}

POST /api/blueprint/progress
Body: {
  updates: ProgressUpdates
}
```

### Data Flow
1. Assessment completion triggers blueprint generation
2. Single API call generates all sections
3. Blueprint stored in user profile
4. Progress tracked separately
5. Return visits show progress overlay
